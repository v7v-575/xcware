<b>Overwiew</b><br>
xcware provides an extensive solution featuring specialized components designed for constructing and deploying a universal computing platform with Sky Computing capabilities. The core components of the xcware platform include:<br>
1. Nexus: Serving as the Admin/User interface for managing and/or interacting with the xcware platform.<br>
2. Nebula: Encompasses all xcware universal computing platform services, transforming the host Linux system into a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).<br>
3. Sky Node: Defined as any Bare Metal/Virtual or Cloud server equipped with Nebula.<br>
Each Sky Node functions as a self-contained xcware universal computing platform, also referred to as a VPC. It can be expanded by integrating nodes from various sources, such as dedicated bare metal/virtual servers or cloud servers located globally. A basic illustration of xcware's components is shown in the figure below.

<b>Sky Computing</b><br>
In simple terms, "Sky Computing" is a model where the xcware Universal Computing layer operates above the cloud, unifying essential business services regardless of the cloud provider. This model boosts agility and provides substantial time and cost savings. Cloud providers are treated as data centers offering vendor-specific services that businesses can utilize as needed.<br>

Sky Computing is often referred to as the next evolutionary step beyond the cloud, as it brings substantial value to businesses by offering greater flexibility and optimization.<br>
