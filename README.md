xcware provides an extensive solution featuring specialized components designed for constructing and deploying a universal computing platform. The core components of the xcware platform include:<br>
1. Nexus: Serving as the Admin/User interface for managing and/or interacting with the xcware platform.<br>
2. Nebula: Encompasses all xcware universal computing platform services, transforming the host Linux system into a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).<br>
3. Sky Node: Defined as any Bare Metal/Virtual or Cloud server equipped with Nebula.<br>
Each Sky Node functions as a self-contained xcware universal computing platform, also referred to as a VPC. It can be expanded by integrating nodes from various sources, such as dedicated bare metal/virtual servers or cloud servers located globally. A basic illustration of xcware's components is shown in the figure below.
